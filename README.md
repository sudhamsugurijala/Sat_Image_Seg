# Satellite Image Segmentation
* Generates base maps of regions by performing image segmentation on satellite images.
* These base maps can be used for performing topological analysis.
  * For example - estimate the topological changes post a natural disaster. 

## How To Run
* Install requirements from text file
* `app.py` is the entry point
* `templates` contains HTML files
* `static` contains pictures, CSS, JS files

In root dir (same level as `app.py`) -
* Create a `weights` folder with sub folders for each class of segmentation targets (like `road`, `building`, `water` etc).
* Store weights in respective subfolders.

## Samples User Flow
* The user uploads an image from their local file system
* A preview of the input image is shown
